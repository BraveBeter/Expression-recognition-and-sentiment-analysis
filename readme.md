## The background of the project
Our school encourages undergraduate research and can sign up for the corresponding program. The teacher we chose happened to be teaching graduate students about computer vision, so she also encouraged us to do a computer vision project. So there was this project, and my team and I finished it in '24 and used it to participate in some competitions.


## The main function of the project
This project mainly realizes the recognition of human facial expressions, and we use some existing efficient models to accomplish this task. On this basis, we designed an interface, and completed the further calculation and reasoning after obtaining the expression analysis, for example, when the proportion of tired expressions appears higher than a certain threshold within a certain number of times, a prompt will be issued. This software is designed to improve the development efficiency of computer users and help them complete the analysis and management of emotional health.
